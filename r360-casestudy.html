            <p><strong>Hi I'm Sanjay Swamidass</strong> I am an experienced UX/UI designer and developer with a demonstrated history of working in the corporate industry. Skilled in Web Design, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML5 & CSS3, and much more. I am a strong design and development professional with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) focused in Web Design from Andrews University</p>
            <p>Currently, I work for a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Corporation umbrella (Mitsubishi EDM/Laser - MC Machinery Systems, Inc.). I've been employed by this company for almost 5 years. I was initially brought on as the lead design/front-end developer to conceptualize, design, and build a remote monitoring web application for the company's machining/fabrication products. This application has served as a reactive & preventative maintenance tool for customers to gain real-time insight, productivity information, and maintenance metrics on their machines. Like all applications, this has been an ongoing project and it continuously evolves to keep up with industry standards. The application has gained great momentum over the past 5 years, and has become an industry leader and often has been the dealbreaker in a sale. </p>
